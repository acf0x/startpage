# Startpage

An iTerm-inspired startpage page.

## Usage

- `search` or `s` + query to search in DuckDuckGo.
- `ls` to list all shortcuts.
- To visit a shortcut, just enter the name of the shortcut in and you'll be redirected.
  - Example: `pro` will redirect to Proton Mail.
  - **NOTE**: If the first few letters are shared with another shortcut, the first one will be used, needing to be more specific. Case example: `git` with GitHub and GitLab.
- Run `weather set` to setup the `weather` command.
- List all available commands with `help`.
